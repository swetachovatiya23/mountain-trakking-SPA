           <p> A sian Trekking was established in 1982 by Ang Tshering Sherpa. Ang Tshering’s family had already been involved in mountain expeditions for many years before that. Ang Tshering’s father, Konchok Chumbi Sherpa was a friend of Sir Edmund Hillary and helped him with the preparation of his ascent of Everest in 1953. <br></br>Konchok Chumbi was also involved in the planning and supplied the porters and equipment for the 1963 American Everest Expedition. With close connections to the mountaineering community, as well as coming from 

the region themselves, the family was well-placed to build a team and facilitate such expeditions. <br></br>From a young age, Ang Tshering knew that his future was in mountaineering and tourism. A natural facilitator, he discovered his talent for liaising between the climbers and the Sherpa teams that were needed to accompany expeditions. With over 40 years professional experience, and even more expedition exposure from childhood, it is not surprising that Ang Tshering’s Asian Trekking brings that wealth of knowledge into its expedition services.</p>
